# Roles Reversed: A Necromancy Strategy Game

## Game Overview
Roles Reversed is an innovative RTS-style game where traditional roles are flipped - you play as the Grim Reaper while the undead and human factions operate autonomously, engaging in an endless battle for dominance. As the Grim Reaper, you control skeleton armies that spread necrotic energy across the map while human factions attempt to stop your corruption.

## Core Gameplay

### The Grim Reaper
Players control the Grim Reaper, who oversees the growth of the undead faction.

 The Grim Reaper's role is to maintain the balance of this eternal conflict by strategically intervening to ensure the undead faction's survival and growth. Players must carefully manage resources and corruption to tip the scales in favor of the undead while preventing the humans from overwhelming their forces.

### Resource System
The game features a dual resource system:
- **PRIMARY_RESOURCE**: Used for constructing buildings and training stronger units
- **SECONDARY_RESOURCE**: Powers the necrotic aura and corruption spread

### Faction Mechanics
#### Undead Faction
- AI-controlled faction
- Skeleton units and bone fortresses
- Necrotic auras that corrupt the surrounding land, damaging human units and healing undead units
- Resource generators that collect bodies and magical energy

#### Human Faction
- AI-controlled opponent faction
- Human settlements and outposts
- Autonomous defense against the spreading corruption
- Resource collection and unit production

### Map Control
