# RT_2025_Game_Jam
Timo and Ryan's 2025 Game Jam. The theme - Roles Reversed

# Notes:
- **Game Concept**
  - Creep Style game - nodes or something get placed down (without player influence?) and then it's autonomous to a degree. 
  - **Mechanics**
    - Creep Spread / Influence
    - Maybe this is similar to Pandemic in terms of gameplay?
      - Maybe this is a more passive game, like cookie clicker, so there will be less player involvement.
      - Reverse They Are Billions
    - Will the player place nodes? I think no.
    - What can the player do?
      - Purchase upgrades
      - Research and Development
      - Set / Prioritize objectives
    - What objectives do we need?
      - Magic (to fuel the growth / research?)
      - Bodies (As a secondary resource)
      - Arms and Armor (for the warriors to defend the kingdom - This would be upgrades)
      - Gold (for the score!)
  - **Gameplay Loop**
    - A node / something gets placed down, and then it exerts influence, and then the world changes in relation to it.
    - Victory is when you corrupt X% of the map.
    - Maybe there is a time limit?
- **Viable Minimum Product**
  - ONE tileset map, we can place A NODE, and then it tries to grow and self-replicate, and the world responds to it.
    - The Node, and all of it's logic:
      - Logic for how it spreads
      - Logic for how it corrupts /  
  - Two objectives - Bodies and Gold
      - "Stretch Goals" would be more objectives.
  - One Building Type, and it can be corrupted and uncorrupted
  - Small agents (Skeletons, Knights?) to traverse the world.
  - Small UI Bar or something where the player can set priorities.
  - **Scope and Time Plan**
    - Need to figure out what the "creep tumor" is, and how it spreads corruption.
    - Need to figure out what populates the world.
    - Need to figure out how things get corrupted?
- **Style / Art Direction**
  - Demonic influence / Corruption
  - Necromancy / Necrotic Energy (I'm thinking this one)
  - Fantasy
- **Genre**
  - How it controls / Input Style / Camera Style / etc.
  - I think we go RTS style... again. HA!
    - Command structure will be much simpler as we won't be inputting a lot of commands
- **Code Structure**
- **Division of Labour**
